This notebook provides documentation to scraping (a local and non reproducable) directory for CNC programs containing threading information. The G76 thread code is extracted as well as information regarding the jobs drawing number, machine tool it was run on, etc, and merged with another dataset containing the material type. This was for referencing a starting point when threading in the future based on previous work knowledge without needing to manually comb through programs.
